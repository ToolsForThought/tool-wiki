# Overview

This is the main repository for the [Tools For Thought Wiki](https://forthought.tools/wiki) - a "Wikipedia about tools for thought". Our aim is to create an accessible and comprehensive lexicon of the many modern tools for modern work. This is a community-led project curated by the team at [Tools For Thought](https://forthought.tools), who are currently managing the 11 000+ [Discord server](https://discord.gg/hGNfbtRPS5) and the 100 000 plus [r/Notion subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/). The website version is updated on a weekly basis, independently of this repository.
