# Overview

This is the main repository for the [Tools For Thought Wiki](https://forthought.tools/wiki) - a "Wikipedia about tools for thought". Our aim is to create an accessible and comprehensive lexicon of the many modern tools for modern work. This is a community-led project curated by the team at [Tools For Thought](https://forthought.tools), who are currently managing the 11 000+ [Discord server](https://discord.gg/hGNfbtRPS5) and the 100 000 plus [r/Notion subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/). The website version is updated on a weekly basis, independently of this repository.

# How to contribute?

If you want to add/modify anything in our wiki, simply open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with your name as the title. Then, make all your edits - when you're done, submit your pull request for review, and if everything looks good, we'll have it merged into the main branch ASAP! You're free to open as many requests as you'd like, just don't open multiple PRs *simultaneously*. If you see an already open PR requesting to merge changes to an article you're planning to work on, wait a bit until it gets approved to make sure your work doesn't get overwritten by someone else.

If you want to write about a tool that *doesn't yet have an article*, duplicate [template.md](https://github.com/ToolsForThought/tool-wiki/blob/master/template.md), rename it with the tool's name, and start writing. Make sure to replace all variables with options from [variables.md](https://github.com/ToolsForThought/tool-wiki/blob/master/variables.md). They are essentially a way to introduce common classification of the tools for quick comparisons. Think of them like "tags".

All articles need to be wrtiten neutrally, from an objective, academic-like point of view. [Useful guide for catching advertisements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_blatant_advertising).
