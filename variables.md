This is a list of variables you need to edit when duplicating and modifying template.md. Best way to do this is via find+replace. Please have this list open while writing a new article and watch out for text in {{}}, which means it's a variable you should modify.

## List

1. **{{tool-name}}** - the tool's name in a human-readable format, the way it is officially spelled and typed. Example: **Standard Notes** instead of **S. Notes**, or **ClickUp** instead of **Click Up**.
2. **{{tool-type}}** - a general, unified descriptor of what the tool does. Quite a few tools do more than one thing, but in *95%* of cases it is possible to generally describe the tool's main purpose.
